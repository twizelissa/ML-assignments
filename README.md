# Formative 3 â€“ Probability, Bayesian Thinking, and Gradient Descent (Group 13)

## Group Members
- Umwanankabandi Liliane  
- Aubert Gloire Bihibindi
- Elissa Twizeyimana 
- Caline Uwingabire 



##  What This Assignment Is About

This group project helped us practice:

- Probability Distributions (like the binomial distribution)
- Bayesian Probability using real-life examples
- Manual Gradient Descent updates using formulas
- Gradient Descent in Python, with graphs showing how the model improves step by step



##  Files in This Project

 File Name                             What It Contains 

Formative3_Group13.ipynb           All Python code (Parts 1, 2, and 4) 
Part3_Manual_Calculations.pdf     Manual work for gradient descent 
 Group_Contribution.pdf             What each group member did 
 README.md                          This file 



##  Tools and Libraries

We used:

- Python (in Google Colab)
- NumPy  
- SciPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Pandas



##  How to Use This

1. Open the notebook (`Formative3_Group13.ipynb`) in Google Colab or Jupyter.
2. Run each cell to see results.
3. Check the PDF files for manual calculations and contribution details.



##  What We Achieved

- Showed how to use probability and Bayes' Rule with examples
- Did manual gradient descent step by step as a group
- Wrote Python code to automate gradient descent and showed it with graphs
- Everyone participated equally and learned from the work
